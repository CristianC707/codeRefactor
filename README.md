CODE REFACTOR REPOSITORY ASSIGNMENT

DESCRIPTION
This homework had me go into someones code and clean it up. I used semantic tags to the best of my knowledge 
and compressed alot of the coding and tried to make it more efficient. I used W3's article on semantic tags 
to help guide me through this process. I also debugged the optimization button in the nav bar by editing it 
in the html file. I also used comments to track my progress and describe what I was doing. I also created a
repository on github and deployed it as a live website within github servers.
